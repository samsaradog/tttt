This project implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using a simple, command
line interface. Compiling and running it should be possible on any standard
Un*x implementation that has a g++ compiler and STL available.

You do need to have cppunit installed, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to point
to where its so file lives.

=====================================

TTTT Game Design

This implementation uses a min/max tree with alpha-beta pruning
to determine the computer move. Unlike the earlier rule-based
implementation, this one should be expandable into larger game
grids.

Many of the components of the rule-based game should be reusable,
such as the Game class to hold the current state of the game,
and the FindWinner object to determine whether the game is in a
winning configuration and whether a winning move is possible.

I may change the numbering scheme initially, but for now it works.

The first thing that will change is making several classes into
singletons, using John Vlissides classic guidance.
