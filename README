This project implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using a simple, 
command line interface. 

=====================================

Building the Game

You will need to have cppunit installed, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to point
to where its shared object file lives.

Compiling and running this code should be possible on any standard
Un*x implementation that has a g++ compiler and STL available.
It has been tested already on MacOS and Ubuntu.

=====================================

TTTT Game Design

This implementation uses a min/max tree with alpha-beta pruning
to determine the computer move. It should be expandable into larger 
game grids: 4x4 or even 3D.

The computer is patient in its move selection. Instead of looking 
for a quick win, it just looks for a move that will lead to 
a win (or draw) eventually. It will also tease you when it knows
that it is going to win.

Enjoy!
