This project implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using a simple, command
line interface. Compiling and running it should be possible on any standard
Un*x implementation that has a g++ compiler and STL available.

You will need to have cppunit installed, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to point
to where its shared object file lives.

=====================================

TTTT Game Design

This implementation uses a min/max tree with alpha-beta pruning
to determine the computer move. Unlike the earlier rule-based
implementation, this one should be expandable into larger game
grids: 4x4 or even 3D.

The computer is now more patient in its move selection. Instead of 
looking for a quick win, it just looks for a move that will lead to 
a win (or draw) eventually.

Many of the components of the rule-based game were reusable,
such as the Game class to hold the current state of the game,
and the FindWinner object to determine whether the game is in a
winning configuration.

Enjoy!
